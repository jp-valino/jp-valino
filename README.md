- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, on here I go by @jp-valino, but my real name is JoÃ£o Pedro (although that might be harder to pronounce).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full-stack coding, web-development, AI, ML and custom keebs, which I have no money to buy unfortunately...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS, Python and Javascript as my first contact points to programming and have been loving doing so thus far!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: e-mail at joaopvalino@gmail.com or reach me on the bird app @jp_valino :)
